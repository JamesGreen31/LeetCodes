                Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

                You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

                EXAMPLE
                -------------------
                Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]

                -------------------
                Constraints:\s
                1 <= s.length <= 105
